Upon clicking the view details button, you will see this same information along with a complete list of members who have RSVP'd and/or to this event. Where in the below example it says "Checked in and RSVP'd", it would say a message correlating to that user's RSVP and attendance record for that event if they had done just one of the two.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the event management process, here are a few tips:

- Ensure you're selecting the correct Google account, one which has administrative access to the app.
- Check your internet connection.
- Past events do not get deleted as they are important for book keeping with points as well as for org use, so the list can get to be quite long, if you are having trouble finding your desired event, try using Ctrl+f and begin entering the event name or date to find the event quickly.

For any further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to other administrator or the app developers
