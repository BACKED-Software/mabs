## User Management Overview

Begin by navigating to the **Admin Tools** section and selecting **User Management** under **Manage Application Users**.

## Searching for Users

To locate a user, you don't need to type the entire name; partial first and/or last names will suffice for specificity.

<img src="/assets/search-users.png" alt="Search Users" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

The user(s) with the searched name will show up in the user list.

<img src="/assets/searched-user.png" alt="Search Users" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

Clearing the search bar will bring back the entire users list.

## Promoting or Demoting Users

As an admin, you can promote a user to an admin role or demote an admin to a user.

A second confirmation will pop up to confirm the action.

- To promote a user, click **Promote to Admin** next to their name.

- To demote an admin, click **Demote to User** next to their name.

<img src="/assets/demote-user.png" alt="Promote or Demote Users" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

**Please be careful to not demote yourself to a user as that will automatically kick you out of the Admin tools!**

## Editing User Titles

Every user initially has a 'Member' title. 
As an admin, you have the capability to edit user titles for specific accounts.

- Click **Edit** next to the user's role to change their title.

Edited user title:

## Deleting Users

In the event that you need to remove a user from the system:

- Click **Remove User** to remove their account from the platform. Similar to Promote and Demote, a second confirmation will pop up to confirm the action.

<img src="/assets/remove-user.png" alt="Delete Users" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
