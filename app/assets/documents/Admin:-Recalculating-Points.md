## Make sure you're logged in as admin

If you are an admin, first log into your admin account.

### Step 1: Go to the Admin Tools Page

From any page, select the **"Admin Tools"** tab to proceed.

If you do not see this option, it means your account is not an admin account. Contact an administrator if you believe this is a mistake.

### Step 2: Scroll to the Bottom and Open the "Recalculate Points" Drop Down Menu

Under the "Maintenance" Section in admin tools, select the "Recalculate Points" drop down.
