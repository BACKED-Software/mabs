## Awarding points to a user

If you are an admin, first log into your admin account

### Step 1: Choose Google Sign Up

From any page, select the **"Admin Tools"** tab to proceed.

If you do not see this option, it means your account is not an admin account. Contact an administrator if you believe this is a mistake. 

### Step 2: Open the "Award User Points" drop down

Under the "Manage Non-Event Points" Section in admin tools, select the "Award User Points" drop down

After selecting this drop down, it should look like this

### Step 3: Fill in the form and press "Award Points"

First, fill in the email for the user who you want to award points. 
Next you will fill in how many points you would like to award. Note that this number CANNOT be negative. 
Then you will select a date of award. Today's date will be automatically filled in, but can be changed if this was for some task in the past (or future). 
Lastly, you will type a brief description of why the points are being awarded.

Finally, select "Award Points". This should refresh the page, and you should get a green success message at the top of the page.

Congratulations! You've successfully awarded a user points!

## Troubleshooting

### User not found error
If you encounter this "user not found" error:

<img src="/assets/awardPointsImages/user-not-found.png" alt="User not found flash message" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

Ensure that the email you are typing into the form is correct, and the user has an account on the application. If the user does not have an account, they just need to sign in with google one time on the app to sign up.  

### There was an error awarding points
If you encounter this error: 

<img src="/assets/awardPointsImages/error.png" alt="User not found flash message" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

There are a few things to double check. First ensure that the points field is filled in with a valid number. This field cannot be a decimal, cannot contain letters or special characters, and cannot be negative. Next ensure that the date field is filled out in the proper format. This can be ensured by using the calendar to select a date, rather than typing it in yourself.

For any further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to an app administrator for assistance.
