Once you click on this button your detailed point history will pop up. This will show a breakdown of all points you have ever received. Points can be awarded in two ways, one which is done automatically through attending events, and one that is done manually by MABS administrators. These different sources of points are differentiated on this list by the green and black labels for attendance and admin-awarded points, respectfully. 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the viewing or login process, here are a few tips:

- Ensure you're selecting the correct Google account.
- Check your internet connection.
- If you believe that there is an error in the summation of your point total, contact an admin as they are able to run a command to rectify any totalling issues.
