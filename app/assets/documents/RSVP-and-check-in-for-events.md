## RSVPing for an Event

If you would like to RSVP for an upcoming event, you can do so from the dashboard

### Step 1: Sign in with Your Google Account

In order to RSVP for an event, you need to be signed in with your Google account. Click on the Sign in With Google button and then select the account you have used to sign up with us and you will be redirected back to the dashboard.

### Step 2: Find the Event You Would Like to RSVP for on the Dashboard

Upcoming events are listed at the bottom of the dashboard and are sorted by time where the nearest events are at the top and later ones are toward the bottom.

### Step 3: Click on the RSVP Button to Sumbit Your RSVP

Once you click on this button your RSVP will be submitted and the administrators of the club will be able to see that you are planning to attend this event. You are also now able to see information about when check in starts for this event, which is usually 15 minutes before official start time. If you would like to remove your RSVP for any reason, you are welcome to do so anytime before check in for the event starts by clicking the Rescind RSVP button shown below.

## Checking in for an Event

Checking in for events are a major way to accumulate points within the app, and checking in for these events can be done in the same place as RSVPing for an event.

### Step 1: Sign in with Your Google Account

As was needed for RSVPing for an event, you need to be signed in with your Google account to check in for an event. Click on the Sign in With Google button and then select the account you have used to sign up with us and you will be redirected back to the dashboard.

### Step 2: Find the Event You Would Like to Check in for on the Dashboard

Upcoming events are listed at the bottom of the dashboard and are sorted by time where the nearest events are at the top and later ones are toward the bottom, so those that are available for check in are going to be found toward the top.

### Step 3: Find the Event Password Posted at the Event and Enter it in the Password Field

To check in for an event a password is required to certify your attendance. This password will be posted at the event by MABS administrators. Enter this password in the password field displayed and click the Check In button to have your attendance recorded. 

<img src="/assets/post-check-in.png" alt="Dashboard Page After Check in" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 200px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

After you have checked in you will notice many changes on your dashboard. A green notice will appear at the top of the page showing that your attendance has been recorded. You will also see your most recent check in displayed in the points summary portion of the dashboard. You will also no longer see a check in field for that event, you will now see a message saying that you are checked in!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the check in process, here are a few tips:

- Ensure you're selecting the correct Google account.
- Check your internet connection.
- If you receive an error message from from an incorrect password, ensure that you are attempting to check in to the correct event and try again, keep in mind that passwords are case senstive.
