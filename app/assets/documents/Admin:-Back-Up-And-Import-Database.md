## Backing up the Database

If you are an admin, first log into your admin account.

### Step 1: Go to the Admin Tools Page

From any page, select the **"Admin Tools"** tab to proceed.

If you do not see this option, it means your account is not an admin account. Contact an administrator if you believe this is a mistake.

### Step 2: Scroll to the Bottom and Open the Backup Database Drop Down Menu

Under the "Maintenance" Section in admin tools, select the "Backup Database" drop down.

After selecting this drop down, it should look like this:

### Step 3: Select the "Backup Database" Button

To complete the backup of the current database, select the yellow backup database button.

After pressing this button, you should be all done! The page will refresh, and you should get a green success message at the top that looks like this:

<img src="/assets/backupDatabaseImages/backup-success.png" alt="Success Message" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

> **Note:** After importing a database, it might be helpful to recalculate points to ensure all data is up-to-date. You can find instructions on how to do this in our [Recalculate Points Guide](/help/Admin:-Recalculating-Points).

Congratulations! You've successfully backed up the database! You can find your backup and download it by selecting the "List Backups" button in the same menu.

<img src="/assets/backupDatabaseImages/backup-list-button.png" alt="Button to list backups" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

That button will take you to this page where you can download or delete your backups.

If you cannot find this dropdown menu, see above.

Clicking this button will open a popup for you to find the file you wish to upload. If you just downloaded it, it should be in your downloads folder.

Select the backup you wish to import, and hit open.

### Step 3: Select "Import Backup" Button

After uploading your backup file, ensure that the correct file has been uploaded here by checking the text to the right of the choose file button. It should look like this:

<img src="/assets/backupDatabaseImages/successful-upload.png" alt="Correct text showing the upload succeeded" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

If the text there matches the database file you mean to import, select the green "Import Backup" button.

The page should refresh, and you should get a green success message at the top that looks like this:

<img src="/assets/backupDatabaseImages/import-success.png" alt="Flash message ensuring successful database import" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
