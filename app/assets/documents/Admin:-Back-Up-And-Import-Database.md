## Backing up the database

If you are an admin, first log into your admin account

### Step 1: Go to the admin tools page

From any page, select the **"Admin Tools"** tab to proceed.

If you do not see this option, it means your account is not an admin account. Contact an administrator if you believe this is a mistake. 

### Step 2: Scroll to the bottom and open the Backup Database drop down menu

Under the "Maitenance" Section in admin tools, select the "Backup Database" drop down

If you cannot find this dropdown menu, see above.

Clicking this button will open a popup for you to find the file you wish to upload. If you just downloaded it, it should be in your downloads folder.

If the text there matches the database file you mean to import, select the green "Import Backup" button

The page should refresh, and you should get a green success message at the top that looks like this:

<img src="/assets/backupDatabaseImages/import-success.png" alt="flash message ensuring successful database import" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 250px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
