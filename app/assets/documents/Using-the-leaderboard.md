# How to Find and Use the Points Leaderboard

Welcome to our guide on how to easily locate and use the Points Leaderboard feature. The Leaderboard is where you will be able to see how your own Point Total ranks against other users.

### Step 1: Sign In

To access the Points Leaderboard, first make sure you are logged in. You will not be able to view the Leaderboard without signing in.

### Step 2: Find the Button on Your Dashboard

Now, locate and click the View Leaderboard button. It is in the Point Summary card on the left-hand side of your Dashboard. This will only appear on your dashboard after you have logged in.

### Step 3: The Leaderboard
You will be immediately redirected to the Leaderboard. You will see your own ranking and points total in the left column (titled “Your Ranking”). 
The right column (titled “Top Users”) displays a ranked list of users (1st to last) with everyone’s names and point totals.

### Step 4: How to View More/All Rankings

At first, “Top Users” only loads in the top 5 ranked users. To see more, look to the bottom of the “Top Users” column where you will see 2 buttons.

 * “View All Users” -- reloads the page and displays a complete ranking of all MABS users within the “Top Users” list.
 * “View More Users” -- reloads the page and adds the next batch of 5 users to the end of the list

**One more thing to note:** Tied users will all be displayed with the same ranking. In this screenshot, 3 users with 0 points all share 7th place.
