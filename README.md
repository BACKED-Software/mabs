## Configuration

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install the required Ruby gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

3. Install JavaScript packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Database Creation and Initialization

Assuming you're using PostgreSQL:

1. Create the database:

```bash
rails db:create
```

2. Migrate the database schema:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

3. Seed the database (if you have a seeds file):

```bash
rails db:seed
```

## How to Run the Test Suite

To ensure the integrity of your application, run the test suite:

```bash
rails test
```

Or, if you are using RSpec:

```bash
rspec
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure all your changes are committed and pushed to the repository.
2. Follow the deployment instructions specific to your hosting provider (Heroku). Ideally this should auto deploy for all non feature branches.
3. Add any new environment variables and add-on services (like database, email services) as required by your application.

## Additional Notes

- Always check the `Gemfile` for any additional gems you might need to install.
- For more detailed information on Rails deployment, consult the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/).
